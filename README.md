You will need to have:

IPL running or I do believe you can have the bob47_ipl resource

the mib_transport folder is a map that adds the panel on the government facility. you need to copy this to your maps folder

start both resources

The script requires that the player has an "mib-id" in their inventory. If the id is not in their inventory the transport wont work. This means that you will have to make an item in your database for the mib-id and make sure you give it to the people you to be able to use this.

if you don't want to add the item you will have to edit the code and remove lines
